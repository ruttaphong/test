    Nice and clean look of company website. 
    
    The web itself is built using Jekyll, a static websites generater from markdown.
    The server is currently hosted githup because it really have zero configuring servers and github is **freaking awesome**.
reflection: |
    Jekyll is awesome -- **seriously**. Most of coperate website just need simple website that can represent there infomation. 
    So static websites should be enought and I don't think the user would know
    the difference as long as it is styled like an modern website should be 
    (which jekyll makes **incredibly easy**).  I love that it also low cost and have almost nothing to maintain.
